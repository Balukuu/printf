ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project
This team project uses a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We collaborated on  this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading.
